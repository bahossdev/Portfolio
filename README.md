## Usage

Upon visiting the portfolio webpage, you will be presented with the developer's name, an avatar, and links to different sections. Clicking on any of the navigation links will smoothly scroll the UI to the corresponding section. If you click on the titles or images in the section about work samples, the developer's applications will open in a new tab.
